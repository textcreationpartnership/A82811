            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Majeſties moſt loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament, cannot conceive that the Declaration which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie received from us at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market,</hi> was ſuch as did deſerve that cenſure your Majeſtie was pleaſed to ſay upon us, in that Speech which your Majeſtie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171287:3"/>made to our Committees there, and ſent in writing to both Houſes; our addreſſe therein being accompanied with plainneſſe, humility, and faithfulneſſe, wee thought more proper for removing the diſtraction of the Kingdome, then if we had then proceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Majeſties Meſſage of the 20. of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> By which your Majeſtie was pleaſed to deſire, that we would declare what we intended to doe for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and what we expected to be done for our ſelves. In both which we have beene very much hindered by your Majeſties denyall to ſecure us and the whole Kingdome, by diſpoſing the <hi>Militia,</hi> as we had diverſe times moſt humbly petitioned, and yet we have not beene altogether negligent of either; having lately made good proceedings in preparing a book of Rates, to be paſſed in a Bill of Tunnage and Poundage: and likewiſe the moſt materiall heads of thoſe humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which we intended to make for the good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of your Majeſtie and your people: but none of theſe could be perfected before the Kingdom be put into ſafety, by ſetling the <hi>Militia;</hi> And untill your Majeſtie ſhall be pleaſed to concurre with your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in theſe neceſſary things, we hold it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to give the World or your People ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction concerning the fears and jealouſies which we have expreſſed, as we hope your Majeſtie hath already received, touching that exception which you were pleaſed to take to Maſter <hi>Pyms</hi> Speech.</p>
            <p>As for your Majeſties feares and doubts, the ground whereof is from ſeditious Pamphlets and Sermons, we ſhall be as carefull to endeavour the removall, as ſoone as wee ſhall underſtand what Pamphlets and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171287:3"/>Sermons are by your Majeſtie intended; as we have beene to prevent all dangerous Tumults. And if any extraordinary concourſe of people out of the Citie to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> had the face and ſhew of tumult and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in your Majeſties apprehenſion, it will appeare to be cauſed by your Majeſties denyall of ſuch a guard to your Parliament as they might have cauſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in, and by taking into White hall ſuch a Guard for your ſelfe, as gave juſt cauſe of jealouſie to the Parliament; and of terrour and offence to your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We ſeek nothing but your Majeſties Honour, and the peace and proſperity of your Kingdomes. And we are heartily ſorry we have ſuch plentifull matter of an anſwer to that queſtion, Whether you had violated our Laws? We beſeech You to remember that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Kingdom as it was in a great part man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by your Miniſters before the beginning of this Parliament, conſiſted of many continued and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Acts of violation of Lawes, the wounds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were ſcarcely healed, when the extremity of all theſe violations, was far exceeded by the late ſtrange and unheard of breach of our lawes in the Accuſation of the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and the five Members of the Commons Houſe, and in the proceedings thereupon: for which we have yet received no full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>To your Majeſties next queſtion, Whether you had denied any Bill for the eaſe and ſecurity of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we wiſh we could ſtop in the midſt of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; that with much thankfulneſſe we acknowledge that your Majeſty hath paſt many good Bils full of contentment, and advantage to your People: But Truth and Neceſſity enforceth us to adde this, That
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171287:4"/>even in or about the time of paſſing thoſe Bils, ſome deſigne or other had been afoot, which if it had taken effect, would not onely have deprived us of the fruit of thoſe Bils, but have reduced us to a worſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of confuſion than that wherein the Parliament found us.</p>
            <p>And if your Majeſty had asked us the third queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intimated in that Speech, what we had done for your ſelfe, our anſwer would have been much more eaſie, That we have paid two Armies wherewith the Kingdom was burthened laſt year; and have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the charge of the war in IRELAND at this time; when through many other exceſſive charges and preſſures, whereby your Subjects have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and the ſtocke of the Kingdom very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; which great miſchiefes, and the charges thereupon enſuing, have been occaſioned by the evill counſels ſo powerfull with your Majeſty, which have and will coſt this Kingdom more than two millions: all which in juſtice ought to have been borne by your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>As for that free and general pardon your Majeſty hath been pleaſed to offer, it can be no ſecurity to our feares and jealouſies, for which your Majeſty ſeemes to propound it; becauſe they ariſe not from any guilt of our own actions, but from the evill deſignes and attempts of others.</p>
            <p>To this our humble Anſwer to that Speech, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to adde an information which we lately received from the Deputy Governour of the Merchant Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers at Roterdam in Holland, That an unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appertaining to the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> did lately ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite one <hi>Iames Henly</hi> a Mariner to go to Elſenore, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171287:4"/>to take charge of a Ship in the Fleet of the King of Denmarke there prepared, which he ſhould conduct to Hull: in which Fleet likewiſe he ſaid a great Army was to be tranſported. And although we are not apt to give credit to Informations of this nature, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not altogether thinke it fit to be neglected, but that it may juſtly adde ſomewhat to the weight of our feares and jealouſies, conſidering with what circumſtances it is accompanied of the Lord <hi>Dighies</hi> preceding expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in his Letter to her Majeſty, and Sir <hi>Lewis Dives;</hi> and your Majeſties ſucceeding courſe of withdrawing your ſelfe Northward from your Parliament, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner very ſutable and correſpondent to that evil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
            <p>Which we doubt will make much deeper impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the generality of your People. And therefore we moſt humbly adviſe and beſeech your Majeſty for the procuring and ſetling the Confidence of your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and all your Subjects, and for the other important reaſons concerning the recovery of Ireland and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Kingdom, which have been formerly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your Majeſty, you will be graciouſly pleaſed with all convenient ſpeed to returne to theſe parts, and to cloſe with the Counſell and deſire of your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: where you ſhall finde their dutifull affections and endeavours, ready to attend your Majeſty with ſuch entertainment, as ſhall not onely give your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty juſt cauſe of ſecurity in their faithfulneſſe; but other manifold evidences of their earneſt intentions and endeavours to advance your Majeſties ſervice, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and contentment; and to eſtabliſh it upon the ſure foundation of the peace and proſperity of all your Kingdomes.</p>
